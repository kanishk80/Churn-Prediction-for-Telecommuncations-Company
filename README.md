This project aimed to predict customer churn using a synthetic dataset, analyze factors influencing churn, and explore customer segmentation. The project involved loading and understanding the dataset, performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) including feature distribution visualizations and correlation analysis, and handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables. In-depth EDA was conducted to investigate relationships between features and churn using visualization techniques and hypothesis testing. Feature engineering created new features to improve model performance. Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, followed by hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. Model interpretation was conducted using feature importance scores and methods like SHAP/LIME. The findings were summarized and presented with key insights and business recommendations.
